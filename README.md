Title: Aubie's Auburn Adventures
Completion Date: April 29, 2016

Project Leader: Adrian Eves
Team Members: Miles Leffler, Jordan Sosnowski, Monroe Moore, Harshil Patel, Ben Petersen, James Odaibo, Jessica Moore, Reggie Cook, Tillman Findley, Morgan Holt, Timothy Tucker

Goal: To create a platform game in 2D about Auburn's mascot, Aubie, that follows a narrative across ten playable levels.

The purpose of this read-me is to document process on game development.
The languages used to create this project are Swift 2 and Java for iOS and Android respectively.

PROGRESS AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2016

It has been decided that the game will span across ten levels: Library, Toomers, Samford (with mini-boss Albert the Alligator),
Student Center, Concouse, Haley (with mini-boss Mike the Tiger), Rec Center, Arena, and Dorms (with mini-boss Hairy Dawg).
The final level of the game will take place within Jordan-Hare Stadium and will conclude with a battle against main boss,
Big Al. Following this, a credit sequence will play in which all team members will be acknowledged.

The main plot of the game is simple: Aubie wakes up Saturday morning in the library after a late night of studying. He
receives a message from an unknown person claiming that Game Day will not be complete without the band director,
quarterback, and the football coach. If Aubie wants to save Game Day, then he will have to rescue these people first.
It is later revealed that Big Al is responsible for rounding up the other mascots and planning this whole complexity.
A complete script has yet to be developed, but it should be done by Friday, March 4 before the trailer airs at the meeting.

Several behaviors have been attributed to Aubie. He can move left or right as the player pleases, he can jump, he can throw
footballs to attack hostile enemies, and he can pick up various items simply by running over them. In terms of motion, Aubie
gains speed the longer he is in motion. Eventually, his acceleration will taper off instead of allowing him infinite speed.
The purpose of this acceleration effect was to keep the user interface as simple as possible. Aubie's motion will be controlled
with a virtual D-Pad located at the lower left portion of the screen. On the lower right side, there will be two action
buttons for throwing and jumping. Aubie can jump as needed to reach platforms. He can also land on his enemies to cause them
damage, which will be his only defense should he run out of footballs. On thin platforms, if the player presses down on the
D-Pad and the jump button on thin platforms, he can jump down through it towards lower ground. He cannot, however, jump through
thick platforms. Aubie can collect and throw footballs at his enemies at any point in the game. To throw a football, the
action button must be pressed. Aubie can collect paw prints to restore his health, and these items are scattered throughout
the game. If Aubie finds a helmet, it gives him temporary invincibility and speed boosts. If he falls into a hole, though, he
will still die. When Aubie dies after running out of health, he will turn into an angel and ascend skyward. Should he die
by falling, he will simply disappear. When the player loses all of his or her lives and gets a game over, the screen will fade to black and the player will
be prompted to continue or quit. Players can collect more lives by finding hidden Aubie heads scattered sparsely throughout the
game.

As of right now, the first three levels of the game have been drawn up and are ready to be built. There will be a few objects
to be made for repeated use, each with their own behaviors. More on that later, though. At the next programmer meeting,
we will create a pseudocode for Aubie's behavior and potentially enemies and some objects. At the next team meeting,
we will end pre-production as we discuss level progress, music progress, and art progress. The demo trailer will be
shown to the team before making a public appearance at the TigerDev Friday meeting.
